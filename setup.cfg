# B error codes come from flake8-bugbear, which we should start using. List of codes: https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear#list-of-warnings
# E error codes come from pycodestyle. List of codes: https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes
# F error codes come from flake8. List of codes: https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html
# LOG error codes come from flake8-logging, which is included in the VSCode Python extension. List of codes: https://github.com/adamchainz/flake8-logging#rules
# S error codes come from sentry-flake8, if we ever start using that. List of codes: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/tools/flake8_plugin.py

# For reference, here are the ones the `sentry` repo ignores (at least as of April 2024). Including these here as a sanity check on future additions to the ignores here:
# extend-ignore = E203,E501,E402,E731,B007,B009,B010,B011,B020,B023,B024,B026,B027

# E203 - Whitespace before `:`, but it's a false positive. See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373
# E501 - Line too long
# E731 - Don't assign a lambda
# LOG005 - Use exception() within an exception handler
# LOG010 - exception() does not take an exception
# LOG011 - Avoid pre-formatting log messages

extend-ignore = E203, E501, E731, LOG005, LOG010, LOG011
